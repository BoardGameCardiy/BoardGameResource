| **Exchange:** Pass **1 card facedown** to another player; the other player looks at it; then passes **1 card back**. | **交换：** 将**1张牌面向下**传给另一位玩家；另一位玩家看过后再传**1张牌回来**。 |
| **Victory:** All players must meet their **goal**. If anyone misses their **goal**, everyone loses the round: | **胜利：** 所有玩家必须达成他们的**目标**。如果任何人未能达成他们的**目标**，则所有人都输掉本回合： |

### Reference for 2-Player Game (2人游戏参考)
|||
| :--- | :--- |
| The **2-player setup** is similar to the 3-player setup, with some changes. | **2人游戏设置**类似于3人游戏设置，但有所变化。 |
| One of the players will control a **shared open hand**, represented by a **card pyramid**. (See back of card.) | 其中一名玩家将控制一个**共享的明牌手牌**，以一个**牌金字塔**表示。（见卡牌背面。） |


---

|||
| :--- | :--- |
| The player dealt the **1 of Rings** will **control the pyramid**, including picking a character for it during **setup** and playing cards from the **pyramid hand** during tricks. | 拿到**魔戒1号牌**的玩家将**控制金字塔**，包括在**设置阶段**为其选择一个角色，并在打牌时从**金字塔手牌**中出牌。 |
| If the pyramid is dealt the **1 of Rings** (neither of the players has the **1 of Rings**), then the pyramid is **Frodo**, and the player to the right of it will **control it**. | 如果金字塔拿到了**魔戒1号牌**（两名玩家都没有魔戒1号牌），那么金字塔就是**弗罗多**，金字塔右侧的玩家将**控制它**。 |

### Old Man Willow (老柳头)
|||
| :--- | :--- |
| **Frodo and Sam beat first upon the tree-trunk where Pippin had lain:** then they **struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held poor Merry:** It was quite useless. | **弗罗多和山姆先是敲打皮平躺过的树干：** 接着他们**拼命挣扎着拉开夹住可怜的梅里**的裂缝的巨口：这完全没有用。 |

### Barrow-wights (古冢尸妖)
|||
| :--- | :--- |
| When he came to himself again, for a moment he could **recall** nothing except a sense of dread. Then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned, caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow: A **Barrow-wight** had taken him, and he was probably already under the dreadful **spells** of the **Barrow-wights** about which whispered tales spoke: | 当他再次清醒过来时，他一时**回想**不起任何事，只感到一阵恐惧。然后他突然知道自己被困住了，无望地被抓住；他在一个古冢里：一个**古冢尸妖**抓住了他，他很可能已经处于那些低语传说中谈论的**古冢尸妖**的可怕**魔咒**之下： |

### The Nine (九戒灵)
|||
| :--- | :--- |
| There were **Nine Riders** at the water’s edge below, and **Frodo’s spirit quailed before the threat of their uplifted faces.** He knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing as **easily** as he had done; and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over the **long path** from the Ford to the **edge** of Rivendell, if once the Riders crossed. | 下方的水边有**九个骑士**，**在他们抬起的面孔的威胁下，弗罗多的精神畏缩了。** 他知道没有什么能阻止他们像他一样**轻易**渡河；如果骑士们一旦渡河，他觉得试图从渡口逃到瑞文戴尔**边缘**的**长路径**上是徒劳的。 |

### Saruman of Many Colours (多色萨鲁曼)
|||
| :--- | :--- |
| **‘For you have come, and that was all the purpose of my message. And here you will stay; Gandalf the Grey; and rest from journeys.** For **I am Saruman the Wise, Saruman Ring-maker; Saruman of Many Colours!’** | **‘因为你来了，这就是我传递消息的全部目的。你将留在这里，灰袍甘道夫；并停止旅行。** 因为**我是智者萨鲁曼，制戒者萨鲁曼；多色萨鲁曼！’** |

### The Doors of Durin (都灵之门)
|||
| :--- | :--- |
| ‘The words are in the **elven-tongue** of the West of Middle-earth in the Elder Days;’ answered Gandalf: ‘But they do not say anything of importance to us. They **only** say: **The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter:** And underneath small and faint is written: [Narvi made them. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs.] | ‘这些文字是中土世界西方在远古时代的**精灵语**；’甘道夫回答：‘但它们没有说任何对我们重要的事情。它们**只**说：**摩瑞亚之王都灵之门。说吧，朋友，然后进入：** 在下面小而模糊地写着：[纳尔维制作了它们。霍林地的凯勒布林博描绘了这些符号。] |
| ‘What does it mean by **speak friend, and enter?**’ asked Merry: ‘That is plain enough;’ said Gimli ‘If you are a friend, speak the **password**, and the doors will open, and you can enter.’ | ‘**说吧，朋友，然后进入**是什么意思？’梅里问道：‘那再清楚不过了；’金雳说 ‘如果你是朋友，说出**口令**，门就会打开，你就可以进入。’ |

### Balin's Tomb (巴林的坟墓)
|||
| :--- | :--- |
| The **Company of the Ring stood silent beside the tomb of Balin**. Frodo thought of **Bilbo and his long friendship with the dwarf; and of Balin’s visit to the Shire long ago.** In that **dusty** chamber in the mountains it seemed a thousand years ago and on the other side of the world. | **魔戒远征队静静地站在巴林的坟墓旁。** 弗罗多想起了**比尔博和他与矮人长久的友谊；以及巴林很久以前访问夏尔的事。** 在山中那个**布满尘土的**墓室里，那似乎已是一千年前，在世界的另一端发生的事。 |

### The Dark (黑暗)
|||
| :--- | :--- |
| They had marched as far as the **hobbits could endure without a rest** and all were thinking of a place where they could sleep, when suddenly the walls to right and left vanished. They seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into a **black and empty space.** There was a great draught of warmer air behind them, and before them the **cold darkness** was on their faces. They **halted and crowded anxiously together.** | 他们已经行进到了**霍比特人能承受的没有休息的极限**，所有人都想着一个可以睡觉的地方，这时突然左右两边的墙壁消失了。他们似乎穿过了一个拱门，进入了一个**黑色而空旷的空间。** 后面有一股温暖气流的大风，而面前的**寒冷黑暗**扑面而来。他们**停下脚步，焦虑地挤在一起。** |

### The Bridge of Khazad-dum (凯萨督姆之桥)
|||
| :--- | :--- |
| It came to the **edge** of the fire, and the light faded as if a cloud had bent over it. Then with a rush it leaped across the fissure. The flames roared up to greet it, and wreathed about it; and a black smoke swirled in the air: Its **streaming mane kindled and blazed behind it.** In its right hand was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it held a whip of many thongs. **‘Ai! ai!’ wailed Legolas ‘A Balrog! A Balrog is come!’** | 它来到了火焰的**边缘**，光线减弱，仿佛一朵云笼罩了它。然后它猛地一跃，跳过了裂缝。火焰咆哮着迎接它，缠绕着它；黑色的烟雾在空气中盘旋：它**飘动的鬃毛被点燃，在身后燃烧。** 它的右手中是一把像刺出的火舌一样的刀刃；左手拿着一根多股的鞭子。**‘啊！啊！’莱戈拉斯哀嚎 ‘一个炎魔！炎魔来了！’** |

### Blindfolded (蒙上眼睛)
|||
| :--- | :--- |
| **‘As was agreed I shall here blindfold the eyes of Gimli the Dwarf:** The others may walk free for a while; until we come nearer to our **dwellings**, down in Egladil in the Angle between the waters.’ | **‘正如所同意的，我将在这里蒙上矮人金雳的眼睛：** 其他人可以自由行走一会儿；直到我们更接近我们在水域之间的安格尔的埃格拉迪尔的**住所**。’ |

### The Mirror (魔镜)
|||
| :--- | :--- |
| But suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole had opened in the world of sight, and Frodo looked into **emptiness**. In the black abyss there appeared a **single Eye that slowly grew, until it filled nearly all the Mirror:** So terrible was it that Frodo stood rooted, unable to cry out or to withdraw his gaze. The Eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself glazed, **yellow** as a cat’s, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing: | 但是魔镜突然完全变黑了，黑得就像视觉世界中开了一个洞，弗罗多看向了**虚无**。在黑色的深渊中出现了一只**单眼，它慢慢变大，直到几乎占据了整个魔镜：** 它如此可怕，以至于弗罗多定在原地，无法喊叫或移开目光。这只眼睛被火光环绕，但本身却是**黄色**的，像猫的眼睛一样，警惕而专注，它瞳孔的黑色缝隙通向一个深渊，一个通往虚无的窗户： |

### The Anduin (安都因河)
|||
| :--- | :--- |
| ‘**Hoy there, Aragorn!**’ shouted Boromir; as his boat bumped into the leader: ‘This is madness! We cannot dare the Rapids by night! But no **boat** can live in Sarn Gebir; be it night or **day!**’ ‘**Back, back!**’ cried Aragorn: ‘Turn! Turn if you can! He drove his paddle into the water, trying to hold the **boat** and bring it round. ‘I am out of my **reckoning**;’ he said to Frodo: ‘I did not know that we had come so far: Anduin flows faster than I thought. **Sarn Gebir** must be close at hand already:’ | ‘**喂，亚拉冈！**’波罗莫喊道；他的船撞上了领头的船：‘这太疯狂了！我们不能在晚上冒险过急流！但在萨恩盖比尔，无论是白天还是**黑夜**，没有**船**能活下来！’ ‘**回去，回去！**’亚拉冈喊道：‘转弯！如果可以的话，转弯！’ 他把桨插进水中，试图稳住**船**并让它转过来。‘我**估算**错了；’他对弗罗多说：‘我不知道我们已经走了这么远：安都因河比我想象的流得更快。**萨恩盖比尔**肯定已经近在眼前了：’ |

### Breaking of the Fellowship (远征队解散)
|||
| :--- | :--- |
| There was no answer: Frodo did not even hear his cries. He was already far away; leaping blindly up the **path** to the hill-top. Terror and grief shook him, seeing in his thought the mad fierce face of Boromir; and his burning eyes. | 没有回应：弗罗多甚至没有听到他的呼喊。他已经走远了；盲目地沿着**小路**跳向山顶。恐怖和悲伤震撼着他，在他的思绪中看到了波罗莫疯狂而凶猛的脸；以及他燃烧的眼睛。 |

### The Road goes ever on and on (路途永不止息)
<div style="display: flex; gap: 2em;">
    <div style="flex: 1;">
    
Down from the door where it began
Now far ahead the Road has gone,
And I must follow, if I can,
Pursuing it with weary feet
Until it joins some larger way
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say.

</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
    
从它起始的门下延伸而去，
如今那条路已远远伸向前方。
而我必须追随，若我仍能，
以疲惫的脚步将它追逐，
直至它汇入更宽广的途径，
在那里许多小径与使命相遇。
而它将通向何方？我却不能言说。

</div>
