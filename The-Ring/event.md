A Balrog is come!’** | 它来到了火焰的**边缘**，光线减弱，仿佛一朵云笼罩了它。然后它猛地一跃，跳过了裂缝。火焰咆哮着迎接它，缠绕着它；黑色的烟雾在空气中盘旋：它**飘动的鬃毛被点燃，在身后燃烧。** 它的右手中是一把像刺出的火舌一样的刀刃；左手拿着一根多股的鞭子。**‘啊！啊！’莱戈拉斯哀嚎 ‘一个炎魔！炎魔来了！’** |

| But suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole had opened in the world of sight, and Frodo looked into **emptiness**. In the black abyss there appeared a **single Eye that slowly grew, until it filled nearly all the Mirror:** So terrible was it that Frodo stood rooted, unable to cry out or to withdraw his gaze.

### The Road goes ever on and on (路途永不止息)

<div style="display: flex; gap: 2em;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
    
Down from the door where it began
Now far ahead the Road has gone,
And I must follow, if I can,
Pursuing it with weary feet
Until it joins some larger way
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say.

</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
    
从它起始的门下延伸而去，
如今那条路已远远伸向前方。
而我必须追随，若我仍能，
以疲惫的脚步将它追逐，
直至它汇入更宽广的途径，
在那里许多小径与使命相遇。
而它将通向何方？我却不能言说。
